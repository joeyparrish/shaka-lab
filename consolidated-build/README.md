# Shaka Lab Consolidated Build Instructions

These are consolidated instructions for our own lab build, from OS installation
to a complete lab.  Your lab may vary.

The instructions are broken into the following sub-documents:

 - [Devices](devices.md): An overview of our lab devices, their hardware, their
   OSes, and the packages we install.  Also includes BIOS/UEFI settings and
   other hardware-specific prep.
 - [Installer Prep](installer-prep.md): Prepare a USB thumb driver to install
   Ubuntu and Windows.
 - [Linux](linux.md): Install and setup Linux
 - [macOS](macos.md): Install and setup macOS
 - [Windows](windows.md): Install and setup Windows
